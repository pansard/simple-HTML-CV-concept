# simple-HTML-CV-concept
It's a simple HTML and CSS webpage made as a CV concept, using custom icons for bulleted lists, separate columns for text and more. 
It's not a serious attempt at building a professional CV, it's more of a proof of concept and some experimentation with 'div' tags for a class project.
